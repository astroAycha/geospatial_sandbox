# Geometry Package

This is a minimalist implementation of the Geometry class, which was presented as an exercise in the Python Programming course (instructor: J.R.) as part of the COGS GIS–Remote Sensing Advanced Diploma program.

This project is a work in progress and is intended for practice and learning purposes.

TO DO: 
- Add ref to OGC (SFA) and ```__geo_interface__```
- Write tests
