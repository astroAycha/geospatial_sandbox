geospatial_sandbox is a space for experimenting with geospatial analysis and related projects. 

The repository is a work in progress as I gradually expand it with new tools, workflows, and explorations. 

It currently includes two projects:

- a minimal implementation of a custom geometry class 
- an initial project examining spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 imagery.
